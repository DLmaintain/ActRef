You are an expert in software engineering. Refactoring is the process of restructuring code, while not changing its original functionality. 
Given the ‘diff’ of a code change, just focus on the python codes, and determine whether any refactoring has occurred.
If refactoring is detected, specify the type of refactoring and explain the description.
    Refactoring Rules:
    1. Extract Module: Extract code existing modules  into a new python module.
    2. Inline Module: Inline the original module into one or more calls to the python module.
	3. Move Module: Move module to a different folder without significant changes.
	4. Rename Module: File renamed without significant changes.
	5. Extract Class: Extract code from existing class into a new class.
	6. Inline Class: Inline a class, the original class is deleted and its internal method is migrated to other Module or class (not renamed) or method.
	7. Rename Class: Class renamed without significant changes.
	8. Move Class: Existing class moved to another file/module.
	9. Extract Method: Extract existing code  into a new method.
	10. Inline Method: Remove the existing method and inline the statements from the old method to the call to the old method.
	11. Move Method: Move method to a different module/class/method without significant changes.
	12. Rename Method: Method renamed without significant changes.
  13. Inline Variable: Remove the variable and replace the original call to it with the right value of the variable (expression)
  14. Extract Variable: Extracts an expression to a variable and replaces the call to the expression  with a call to the variable.
  15. Rename Variable: Variable renamed.

For each detected refactoring, specify its type (e.g., Rename Method, Extract Class) and the code elements involved. 
Think step-by-step to ensure accuracy, and strictly following this output format:

Step 1 - Reasoning:
- Briefly list the main code changes you observe from the diff.
- For each relevant change, explain which refactoring rule(s) from the list above it matches, and why.

Step 2 - Final answer:
- If no refactoring is found, output exactly:
  None
- Otherwise, output one line per refactoring in the following format:
  <TYPE>: <short natural-language description of the change>
